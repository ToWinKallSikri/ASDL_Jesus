/**
 * Class that provides an implementation of a "dynamic" min-priority queue based
 * on a ternary heap. "Dynamic" means that the priority of an element already
 * present in the queue may be decreased, so possibly this element may become
 * the new minumum element. The elements that can be inserted may be of any
 * class implementing the interface <code>PriorityQueueElement</code>. This
 * min-priority queue does not have capacity restrictions, i.e., it is always
 * possible to insert new elements and the number of elements is unbound.
 * Duplicated elements are permitted while <code>null</code> elements are not
 * permitted.
